## ðŸ“– Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction in data analysis and machine learning. PCA reduces the number of features in a dataset while retaining most of the variability (information). This makes it ideal for simplifying complex datasets and avoiding overfitting in machine learning models.

PCA transforms the original features into new variables called Principal Components (PCs), ordered by the amount of variance they capture in the data.

## ðŸš€ Key Concepts

1. Dimensionality Reduction: PCA helps reduce the number of input variables without losing much information, especially for high-dimensional data.

2. Principal Components (PCs): These are new, uncorrelated features that are linear combinations of the original variables. The first component captures the most variance, followed by subsequent components.

3. Explained Variance: Measures how much information (variance) each principal component captures from the original dataset.

4. Orthogonality: Principal components are orthogonal (uncorrelated) with each other, ensuring no overlap in the variance they represent.


## ðŸ’¡ Applications

1. Feature Reduction: Reduces redundant or less informative features.

2. Data Visualization: Visualizes high-dimensional data by projecting it onto 2 or 3 principal components.

3. Speeding Up Models: Reduces computational complexity and training time by decreasing the number of features.
